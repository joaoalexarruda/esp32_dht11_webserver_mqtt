# ESP32 and DHT11 sensor web server

This is a simple web server running on an ESP32 that serves a web page with the current temperature and humidity from a DHT11 sensor.
It also publishes the temperature and humidity to a MQTT broker.

It's an assignment for the unit "Internet of Things" from the [Data Science and Digital Transformation](https://www.ipportalegre.pt/pt/oferta-formativa/pos-graduacao-data-science-and-digital-transformation) post-graduation course at the [Instituto Polit√©cnico de Portalegre](https://www.ipportalegre.pt/pt/), Portugal.
